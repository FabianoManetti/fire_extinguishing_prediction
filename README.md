# Definition

In order to **predict the functionality status of acoustic fire extinguisher**, it was asked to create a machine learning model based on different features.

# Dataset

The dataset was obtained as a result of the extinguishing tests of four different fuel flames with a sound wave extinguishing system.

| **Feature Name** | **Description**                                                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SIZE**         | Sizes of liquid fuel cans used to achieve different size of flames |
| **FUEL**         | Three different liquid fuels and LPG fuel used to create the flame |
| **DISTANCE**     | Distance of the fuel container from the extinguisher (cm)          |
| **DESIBEL**      | Desibel of the acoustic fire extinguisher (dB)                     |
| **AIRFLOW**      | Airflow of the acoustic fire extinguisher (m/s)                    |
| **FREQUENCY**    | Frequency sound waves of the fire extinguisher (Hz)                |
| **STATUS**       | 0 indicates non-extinction state, 1 indicates the extinction state |
